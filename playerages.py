ans:
def find_player_ages(total_age):
    a = (total_age - 10) // 3
    age_x = a
    age_y = a
    age_z = a + 10
    
    return age_x, age_y, age_z

# Example input
total_age_input = int(input("Enter the total age: "))
ages = find_player_ages(total_age_input)

# Output the ages
for age in ages:
    print(age)
